			<p id="Introduction">Birds, scientifically known as <i>avians</i>, are
			quite fascinating, aren't they? However, what if
			I told you in this very meeting that they may
			not be real? This needs investigation, but for
			now, I've laid out some valuable evidence to
			prove my intellectual claim.</p>

					<h3>Exhibit A: birds can rest on wires</h3>
					<ul>
					<li>WTF(what the frick) birds can rest on
					electric wires??????
					<li> In Pokemon, we learn that <b>flying
							types</b> are
						weak to <b>electric types</b>, so they should be
					dead, but they're clearly alive, so they must be
					robots created by the federal government
					</ul>

					<p><strong>WHEN CONDUCTING YOUR OWN
						EXPERIMENTS, BE CAREFUL! I = V/R
					AND WITH A VOLTAGE OF 120 VOLTS, I =
					OUCHY OUCHY SO MAKE SURE TO TAKE
					PRECAUTIONS, OKAY? DON'T WANT TO END UP
					LIKE A FLYING TYPE POKEMON AFTER A
					THUNDERBOLT!</strong></p>

						<h3>Exhibit B: I never actually saw a
							bird</h3>
						<p>
							Simple as that. I've never saw
							one, so they don't exist. I
							haven't gone outside in decades
							though so that may explain it,
							but still, government created
							robots.

						<h3>Exhibit C: Government lied
							to us about round
							earth</h3>
						<p>
							Are you unironically
							going to believe a
							<strong>corrupt
							institution</strong> that
							has the audacity to lie
							to us about round Earth?
							The Earth is clearly as
							flat as a piece of paper
							and yet there are
							imbeciles who believe it
							and trust the
							government. Are you
							really going to believe
							them again after they
							lied to you? Would you
							trust an abuser?
						</p>
						<p>In case if you still need
						proof, here are reasons why the
						earth is flat </p>
						<ol>
							<li>Why aren't my shoes
								curved?
							<li>My dad fell off the
								edge and never
								came back :(
							<li>It's the simplest
								explanation, so
								with Occam's
									razor, it's
								common sense
							<li>Newton died a
								<em>virgin</em>,
								and I have a
								girlfriend from
								Wakanda, so I'm
								better than him
								and my theory is
								correct.

							<dt>Evenly divided on political

							<dt>There's this one guy named Jeremy
							who agreed with me. Thanks Jeremy</dt>
							
							<dt>Ok who the frick voted Ice Cream I'm
